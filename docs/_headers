# Cache Next.js build assets with a long max-age and immutable flag.
# (These files include hashes so they are immutable.)
/_next/static/*
  Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000, immutable

# Optionally (no need yet), if you want to ensure that any non-HTML assets (for example,
# images, fonts, etc.) that are not under /_next/static or /static are cached,
# you could add additional rules. For example, for images:
# /images/*
